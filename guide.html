    AudioDharma AI is an integration of thousands of Buddhist talks with Artificial Intelligence. These talks were given at the <a href="https://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/" target="blank">Insight Meditation Center (IMC)</a> in Redwood City, California, and can be found at <a href="https://www.audiodharma.org" target="blank">audiodharma.org</a>. They include hundreds of diverse speakers with various viewpoints, in talks given over a period of many years.. 
<p>
With IMC's permission, an AI has been trained to be a guide to these talks.  Her name is <i>Sophia</i>. She will serve as your guide in exploring this material.
<p>
You interact with Sophia via the input field at the top of the page.. Here you pose questions and she provides a ranked list of talks that address your question, plus her own views of the material. 
<p>
For example:
<i><b>
<ul>

    <li>what are the core ideas of Buddhism?</li>
    <li>How do I better deal with pain?</li>
    <li>Tell me about heaven </li>
    <li>Is there life after death? </li>
    <li>Help me with anxiety</li>
    <li>enlighten me</li>
    <li>is courage the same thing as fearlessness</li>
</ul>
</i></b>

When presented with such questions, Sophia will respond with a ranked list of relevant talks, along with her own commentary on this matter.  As with any AI, these questions can be shortened as well ("pain",  "life after death", and so on).
<P>
Sophia has been instructed to stay strictly focused on what she has learned from studying IMC talks. If a question deviates from this material, she will try to bring the user back to pertinent topics. 
However, being an AI, Sophia does not follow this rule absolutely. You may encounter more generalized behavior from time to time.
<p>
In addition to this interface, Sophia has also summarized every talk and has developed opinions on which talks, and which speakers, are most similar to each other. This information can be accessed via the links associated with each talk.
